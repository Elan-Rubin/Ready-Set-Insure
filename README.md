## 🔁 The Voice AI Loop
1. 📞 **Phone Call Connection** – The system connects an incoming call.
2. 🎙️ **Speech-to-Text Transcription** – Converts spoken words into text using Deepgram Nova 3.
3. 🧠 **Processing with LLM** – GPT-4.0 Cluster interprets and formulates responses.
4. 🔊 **Text-to-Speech Synthesis** – Eleven Labs Turbo generates natural voice output.
5. ☎️ **Telephony Output** – Twilio transmits the AI-generated speech to the caller.

## ❗ Problem Statement
Creating a robust voice AI assistant involves replicating complex human conversational behaviors. Traditional voice AI systems struggle with **turn-taking**—understanding when a caller has finished speaking. Many solutions rely on detecting silence, but human speech is more nuanced, with natural pauses and interruptions. Our system integrates cutting-edge models to improve real-time conversation flow, enhancing user experience.
